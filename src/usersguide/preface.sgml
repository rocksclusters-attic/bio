Bio-Informatics is the use of techniques from applied mathematics,
informatics, statistics, and computer science to solve biological
problems. Major research efforts in the field include sequence
alignment, gene finding, genome assembly, protein structure
alignment, protein structure prediction, prediction of gene
expression and protein-protein interactions, and the modeling of
evolution.

<para>
To address the requirements of these efforts, a wide spectrum of
bio-informatics tools are available. These tools, while powerful,
are packaged according to the individual tastes of the developers.

<para>
The Bio-informatics Roll is a collection of some of the most
common bio-informatics tools that are being used by the community
today. This roll is being developed in an attempt to standardize
and ease 
packaging and installation of these tools.
